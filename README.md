# File Finder 0.1

A command line GUI tool to find files with filename using -f flag or with content using any other flag. It should technically work for any windows, linux, and mac but has only been tested with windows. I was planning on making it cross-platform but after much thought I have realized mac already has a good search system and even linux must have something. So I won't be realeasing any more version of this but I do plan on writing one for only windows because the GUI search of windows is trash.
